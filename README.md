# Hotel Booking Analysis Using MySQL

### Project Overview

##### Objective

#### This project encompasses a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking data, with a key emphasis on uncovering customer behavior, assessing the performance of diverse hotels, and scrutinizing reservation cancellation patterns within specific market segments

### Key Questions and Analyses:

#### Hypothesis

##### 1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.

##### Price-Related Cancellations: Our extensive analysis underscores that higher prices do indeed contribute to an increased rate of cancellations. This finding suggests that pricing plays a significant role in clients' decision-making processes when it comes to reservation cancellations. It is crucial for hotel management to carefully consider their pricing strategies and find a balance that maximizes revenue without driving potential guests away due to cost concerns. Factors such as service quality and maintenance standards should also be optimized to align with the price point, ensuring a positive guest experience.

##### 2. January month has the highest number of Booking.

##### Monthwise Booking and Cancellation Patterns: Our in-depth investigation reveals the patterns in reservation data. Contrary to the second hypothesis, January does not register the highest number of bookings; instead, August stands out as the month with the highest booking activity. On the other hand, January indeed demonstrates the highest cancellation rate. These observations emphasize the need for targeted strategies to address fluctuations in booking and cancellation trends across different months.

##### 3. The majority of Clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

##### Client Reservation Channels: The analysis provides valuable insights into the channels through which clients make their reservations. Contrary to the third hypothesis, the majority of clients are found to favor online travel agencies (OTAs) when making their bookings.
